# CLO-waterfall-simulation
This project simulates the interest waterfall and compliance mechanics of a simplified Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO). The model illustrates how Overcollateralization (OC) test results impact cash flow distributions to Senior, Mezzanine, and Equity tranches.

## Features

- Tranche-level interest allocation with payment priority
- OC test logic with threshold control
- Two modeled scenarios:
  - Base Case (OC test passes)
  - Stress Case (OC test fails due to reduced collateral)
- Excel-based cash flow and compliance logic
- Python-based automation and visualization using `pandas` and `matplotlib`
- LaTeX write-up and optional compiled PDF analysis
